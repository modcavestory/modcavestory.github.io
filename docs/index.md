# ModCS

This is the official site for **ModCS**, a Cave Story modding utility, which's main feature is a Lua scripting API. The Lua API currently easily allows you to make custom HUD elements, easily modify and make NPCs and create custom [TextScript](/api/tsc/) commands. 

This project was started to give people a more accessible way to make advanced Cave Story mods, without having to deal with Assembly and the limitations of the original executable of the game. This was also started to give people a somewhat more legal way to make advanced modifications, you can read more on that in the [License](/license/). 

Currently ModCS is not officially out, but you may still read the documentation for its API.
