# ModCS

This is the official site for **ModCS**, a Cave Story modding utility, which's main feature is a Lua scripting API. The Lua API currently easily allows you to make custom HUD elements, easily modify and make NPCs, create custom weapons and create custom [TextScript](/api/tsc/) commands. 

This project was started to give people a more accessible way to make advanced Cave Story mods, without having to deal with Assembly and the limitations of the original executable of the game. This was also started to give people a somewhat more legal way to make advanced modifications. 

To get started you may be interested in the [Getting Started section](/guide/intro/), which contains a brief overview of basic Cave Story Modding before getting into Lua scripting.
