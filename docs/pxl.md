# PXL Map Files

ModCS allows for an optional [Map](/api/map/) file with the extension `.pxl`. PXL (PixLayer) files follow the same format as PXM files. As the name suggests PXL files allow for multiple tile layers. Any foreground tiles placed in a PXL file will be drawn over PXM foreground tiles and any background tiles placed in a PXL file will be drawn under PXM background tiles.
