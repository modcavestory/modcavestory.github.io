# License and Legality

ModCS is based on **Cave Story Engine 2**, which is a decompilation of the original freeware release of Cave Story, which means that decompilation related code in this project is owned by Nicalis Inc., Clownacy, CuckyDev and GabrielTFS... But mostly Nicalis.

Now, I know that **this project is legally wrong**, but I'm sincerely hoping  it does not get taken down by Nicalis. The [Cave Story Modding Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/xRsWpz6) and the [Cave Story Mod Database](http://doukutsu.club) both allow CSE2 mods to be shared **as long as any source code is not distributed**. This project was, after all, started because I wanted to give people a more accessible way to do advanced Cave Story modding without having to use CSE2.

All of the reasons I *assume* Nicalis would want to take down CSE2 don't necessarily apply to a project like this... but at the same time nobody really knows exactly why they would take it down. If this eventually gets a DMCA notice then, I dunno, I'll probably move it to Clownacy Modloader, or something.

If you are not a Nicalis representative and think that this project harms Nicalis Inc.'s sales, please use one of the following hotkeys to download the Nicalis-friendly version of this project:

- Ctrl+W
- Alt+F4
- The power button on your computer

*(I'm joking, a "legal" Cave Story mod doesn't exist. Nicalis can DMCA Freeware mods too, it's just a matter of "what do they want to take down", so screw off now.)*
